I honestly don't know what I'm doing, so I will just write things down as they come to me:

* I/O needs to take in video, a multilayer image + some others I guess, a bunch of parameters, and output a video
* The input must be divided into nodes and made and the values must be stored.
* Specific nodes to track: Stationary nodes like the nose, and eye corners, dynamic nodes like the tops and bottoms of the eyes and mouth
* A system to take that information and map it to certain expressions, as well as use the rotation to generate curvilinear distortions to make the form appear 3d
* A system to take the rotation data and use it to apply 3d perspective equations to a curvilinear plane of polygons
* A polygon system made up of nodes to divide an image into a mesh of polygons that can be independently distorted
* A bone rigging structure, probably using straight node connections to make a rigid form
* A method to use interpolations to accurately distort each polygon
* A method of outputting the constantly distorted image as video to some recording/ streaming mechanism
*A GUI that gives direct access to all of these values such that they can be intuitively altered with visualization
